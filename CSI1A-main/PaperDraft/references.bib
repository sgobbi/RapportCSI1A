abstract = {Questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (VR) user studies. Transitioning from virtuality to reality for giving self-reports on VR experiences can lead to systematic biases. VR allows to embed questionnaires into the virtual environment which may ease participation and avoid biases. To provide a cohesive picture of methods and design choices for questionnaires in VR (inVRQ), we discuss 15 inVRQ studies from the literature and present a survey with 67 VR experts from academia and industry. Based on the outcomes, we conducted two user studies in which we tested different presentation and interaction methods of inVRQs and evaluated the usability and practicality of our design. We observed comparable completion times between inVRQs and questionnaires outside VR (nonVRQs) with higher enjoyment but lower usability for inVRQs. These findings advocate the application of inVRQs and provide an overview of methods and considerations that lay the groundwork for inVRQ design.},

  abstract  = "A virtual-reality setup was used to investigate the relationship
               between perceived body ownership and subjective anxiety, as
               assessed by an anxiety inventory (SA-I). A pilot study confirmed
               that synchrony between the participant's real hand movements and
               the movements of a virtual effector induced perceived ownership
               illusions. The illusions were comparable for virtual human hands
               and virtual cat claws, even though the overall acceptance was
               greater for human hands. In Experiment 1, participants used the
               virtual effector to collect coins and avoid knives descending on
               a screen before anxiety was measured. The level of anxiety
               increased with synchrony and was higher for human hands than for
               cat claws, but these two effects were independent. Experiment 2
               separated effects of coin catching and knife avoiding by means
               of a between-participant design. The outcome of Experiment 1 was
               replicated in the knife-avoiding task but not in the
               coin-catching task, in which anxiety levels were low and not
               systematically affected by the type of virtual effector. Taken
               altogether, our findings suggest that subjective anxiety and
               ownership are strongly related.",

abstract = {Improving the sense of “presence” is a common goal of three-dimensional (3D) display technology for film, television, and virtual reality. However, there are instances in which 3D presentations may elicit unanticipated negative responses. For example, it is well established that violations of interpersonal space cause discomfort in real-world situations. Here we ask if people respond similarly when viewing life-sized stereoscopic images. Observers rated their level of comfort in response to animate and inanimate objects in live and virtual (stereoscopic projection) viewing conditions. Electrodermal activity was also recorded to monitor their physiological response to these stimuli. Observers exhibited significant negative reactions to violations of interpersonal space in stereoscopic 3D displays, which were equivalent to those experienced in the natural environment. These data have important implications for the creation of 3D media and the use of virtual reality systems.},
