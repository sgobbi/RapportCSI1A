ABSTRACT={<p>Humans have an exceptional ability to execute a variety of skilled movements. Researchers have been long interested in understanding behavioral and neurophysiological basis of human motor skill learning for advancing both fundamental neuroscientific knowledge and clinical outcomes. However, despite decades of work in this field there is a lack of consensus about what is meant by “skill” in skill learning. With an advent of various task paradigms testing human motor behavior and increasing heterogeneity in motor learning assessments methods, it is very crucial to identify key features of skill in order to avoid any ambiguity that may result in misinterpretation or over-generalization of findings, which could have serious implications for replication and translational research. In this review, we attempt to highlight the features of skill following a historical approach, considering the seminal work that led to the first definitions of skill and including some contemporary concepts emerging from human motor learning research. Overall, based on this literature, we emphasize that skill has some fundamental characteristics, such as- (i) optimal movement selection and execution, (ii) improved movement speed and accuracy, and (iii) reduced movement variability and error. These features of skill can emerge as a consequence of extensive practice/training/learning, thus resulting in an improved performance state beyond baseline levels. Finally we provide some examples of model tasks that can appropriately capture these features of skill, and conclude that any neuroscientific endeavor aimed at understanding the essence of skill in human motor skill learning should focus on these aspects.</p>}

  abstract  = "Implicit motor learning is an established motor learning
               technique that has been largely overlooked outside of academia.
               It is beneficial to learners in that it allows them to perform
               undisrupted even in the face of stress and other adverse
               conditions. This is thought to be due to a reduced ability to
               `reinvest' acquired knowledge -- something that can cause the
               performer to `manually override' what should be an automatic
               movement. The problem with traditional forms of implicit motor
               learning is their impracticality in applied settings. To that
               end, in this paper we attempt to provide a jumping off point for
               practitioners by briefly outlining the theoretical concepts of
               implicit learning and the difficulties it faces. From there, we

  abstract  = "The development of more effective rehabilitative interventions
               requires a better understanding of how humans learn and transfer
               motor skills in real-world contexts. Presently, clinicians
               design interventions to promote skill learning by relying on
               evidence from experimental paradigms involving simple tasks,
               such as reaching for a target. While these tasks facilitate
               stringent hypothesis testing in laboratory settings, the results
               may not shed light on performance of more complex real-world
               skills. In this perspective, we argue that virtual environments
               (VEs) are flexible, novel platforms to evaluate learning and
               transfer of complex skills without sacrificing experimental
               control. Specifically, VEs use models of real-life tasks that
               afford controlled experimental manipulations to measure and
               guide behavior with a precision that exceeds the capabilities of
               physical environments. This paper reviews recent insights from
               VE paradigms on motor learning into two pressing challenges in
               rehabilitation research: 1) Which training strategies in VEs
               promote complex skill learning? and 2) How can transfer of
               learning from virtual to real environments be enhanced? Defining
               complex skills by having nested redundancies, we outline
               findings on the role of movement variability in complex skill
               acquisition and discuss how VEs can provide novel forms of
               guidance to enhance learning. We review the evidence for skill
               transfer from virtual to real environments in typically
               developing and neurologically-impaired populations with a view
               to understanding how differences in sensory-motor information
               may influence learning strategies. We provide actionable
               suggestions for practicing clinicians and outline broad areas
               where more research is required. Finally, we conclude that VEs
               present distinctive experimental platforms to understand complex
               skill learning that should enable transfer from therapeutic
               practice to the real world.",

               to what extent VR training tools can be applied for motor
               learning of complex movements. Previous VR studies primarily
               relate to realize performances rather than learning motor
               skills. Therefore, the current study compared VR with video
               training realizing the acquisition of karate technique, the Soto
               Uke moving forward in Zenkutsu Dachi, without being accompanied
               by a trainer or partner. Further analyses showed whether a less
               lavished forearm compared to a whole-body visualization in VR is
               necessary to acquire movements' basics sufficiently. Four groups
               were tested: 2 groups conducted VR training (VR-WB: whole-body
               visualization, and VR-FA having only visualized the forearms),
               the third group passed through a video-based learning method
               (VB), and the control group (C) had no intervention. In
               consultation with karate experts, a scoring system was developed
               to determine the movements' quality divided, into upper- and
               lower body performance and the fist pose. The three-way ANOVA
               with repeated measurements, including the between-subject factor
               group [VR-WB, VR-FA, VB, C] and the within-subject factors time
               [pre, post, retention] and body regions [upper body, lower body,
               fist pose], shows that all groups improved significantly (except
               for C) with the similar course after four training sessions in
               all body regions. Accordingly, VR training seems to be as
               effective as video training, and the transfer from VR-adapted
               skills into the natural environment was equally sufficient,
               although presenting different body visualization types. Further
               suggestions are made related to the features of future VR
               training simulations.",
